            LoL Boosting is an essential part of the solo queue gaming experience due to
            itâ€™s ability to create a positive mindset by playing stress free for a very
            low cost. Nobody wants to be miserable and spend weeks grinding their
            previously owned rank back from a bad loss streak, just to save a few bucks.
